# Checking Hardware Info


## Linux

`dmidecode`: Great for querying smbios params/info (see DMTF DSP0134 - System Management BIOS (SMBIOS) Reference Specification)

`lshw`: Useful to query all devices attached to the system, displaying vendor/product IDs etc

## Windows

`systeminfo`: similar in principle to `lshw`

`taskmgr`: Displays some information about hardware, whether the system is virtualized etc

`al-khaser`: In-depth testing of hardware to detect virtualized environment
